# IPCV-Experiments

EXP-01:-To study and implement basic image processing operations using OpenCV and NumPy, including image reading, color space conversion, channel splitting, image arithmetic operations, and geometric transformations.The experiment successfully demonstrates basic image manipulation techniques using OpenCV, helping to understand how digital images are processed and analyzed in computer vision systems.

EXP 02:-To study and implement basic image transformation techniques for image enhancement using Python and OpenCV.This experiment demonstrates how different image transformation techniques enhance image quality and reveal hidden details. These methods are fundamental in image processing applications such as medical imaging, computer vision, and pattern recognition.

EXP 03:-This project demonstrates Image Enhancement using Histogram Equalization, implemented as part of IPCV (Image Processing and Computer Vision) Experiment No. 03. The objective is to improve image contrast by redistributing pixel intensity values using both manual implementation and OpenCV’s built-in method.Histogram Equalization significantly improves image contrast by spreading pixel intensities across the available range. The manual implementation helps in understanding the internal working of the algorithm, while OpenCV provides a fast and optimized built-in solution. Both approaches yield comparable enhancement results.
